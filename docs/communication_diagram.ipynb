    "The following Diagram shows the general communication pattern of the network, and is meant to \"humanize\" the process.\n",
    "* Thought bubbles indicate the logic being executed\n",
    "* Speech bubbles indicate either node-to-node communciation or broadcasts \"e.g. SHOUTING!\" which is heard by all nodes.\n",
    "* Circles are meant to show how a variable is being updated.\n",
    "* Callouts are stacked in the order by which they happen, with older messages on the bottom. They are also arranged in such a way that their placement relative to surrounding line-edges and callouts is significant.\n",
    "* line-edges represent formal relationships (e.g., processes) and the callouts should be read counter-clockwise \n",
